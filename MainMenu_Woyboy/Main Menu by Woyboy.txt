Overview
Main Menu is a small package I created to help projects implement a main menu along with the basic needs of a main menu. This includes a detailed settings menu that handles the volume, mouse sensitivity, resolution, and fullscreen check. This project can be easily expanded into multiplayer projects if you so desire, but the only thing needed to be changed is the mouse sensitivity. The package contains a prefab and scripts with many comments that guides and explains how everything works. Some scripts are self-explanatory. Additionally, this package contains a Spectral font from Google Fonts. Enjoy!
