# 🎮 Main Menu
## By Woyboy

## Unity Version 6000.0.45f1


### 🚀 Overview
Main Menu is a small package I created to help projects implement a main menu along with the basic needs of a main menu. This includes a detailed settings menu that handles the volume, mouse sensitivity, resolution, and fullscreen check. This project can be easily expanded into multiplayer projects if you so desire, but the only thing needed to be changed is the mouse sensitivity. The package contains a prefab and scripts with many comments that guides and explains how everything works. Some scripts are self-explanatory. Additionally, this package contains a Spectral font from Google Fonts. Enjoy!


## 📁 How to setup
Download the UnityPackage file. If your project doesn’t already contain an audio mixer asset, go ahead and create one. Assign the AudioMixer to your Main Menu Runtime prefab. The SettingsManager.cs goes through the AudioMixer’s exposed parameters of “MasterVolume” as shown here. Other than that, everything else works completely fine!
